With the accelerated growth of advanced optic and electronic sensors, as well as elevated and high-effective computer vision and machine learning algorithms, real-time driving scene interpretation has become increasingly realistic. In driving scenes, lane detection and object localization is a crucial module for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver aid systems. We have tried to come up with an amalgmation of both lane detection in object tracking in real time systems.
